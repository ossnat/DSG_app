# Data Processing Application

## Overview
This application processes CSV files containing time series data with amplitudes, velocities, and labels. It trains models based on your input data and generates visualization plots of the results.

## Input Data Format
The application requires input data in CSV format with specific fields:

### Required CSV Structure
Your CSV files should contain the following columns:
- Columns 0-49: Time series data points
- `labels`: Classification labels for each entry
- `max amplitude`: Maximum amplitude value
- `final amplitude`: Final amplitude value
- `max velocity`: Maximum velocity value

### Training and Testing Files
Prepare two separate CSV files:
- `train.csv`: Used for model training
- `test.csv`: Used for model validation

## Running the Application
1. Run the application with: `python main.py`
2. Upload `train.csv` or `test.csv` when required

## Output
All results will be stored in the `results` directory:
- `models/`: Trained model files
- `plots/`: Visualization of results and model performance

## Example
For a properly formatted CSV, the first few columns should look like:
```
0,1,2,3,4,...,49,labels,max amplitude,final amplitude,max velocity
0.23,0.25,0.28,0.30,...,0.85,1,3.56,2.48,4.12
0.18,0.22,0.25,0.29,...,0.76,0,2.98,1.87,3.45
...
```
